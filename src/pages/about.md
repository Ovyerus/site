## Overview

Hi there! I'm Michael, but I go by Ovyerus online. I'm a professional frontend
web developer, but work on a load of open source stuff outside of work.

Most of my free time is spent programming, mostly on my various open source
projects but also on some closed source projects of my own/for communities I'm a
part of. Besides programming, I also enjoy video games of a wide variety, as
well as dabble in music production and various other hobbies such as mechanical
keyboards. <!-- and 3d printing (soon I hope!) -->

Important information from me will be signed with the following
[Minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) public key:

```
RWTpyM3qeubTqtQcJhF6nHjLldECb4Y0yG4iMbxcf+wn6DiGpOe6ZTfI
```

If you need to send encrypted files or information to me for one reason or
another, I use [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) encryption, not
GPG/PGP. Because my age keys are resident on my hardware security keys, you will
need the [age-plugin-yubikey](https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey)
extension in order to be able to encrypt a payload for me.

My age recipients are as follows:

```
age1yubikey1qv5zj6kstrmdw5ydqs72fh624c262qjckgq0hkqrccl6h3puu8esj3f2a7s
age1yubikey1qtmxuagrpq8jn5yrt79qcmj9ns2r5gmhdmu6tt6zqdraz5duwugzksegq4q
```

This list is also available at [/age.txt](/age.txt).

I can be easily reached at [ovy@ovyerus.com](mailto:ovy@ovyerus.com), or on my
[Mastodon account](https://aus.social/@ovyerus).

**You may not contact me about anything cryptocurrency/"Web3"/NFT related.**

Here's some interesting points about me:

- I've been using [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) as my keyboard layout for more
  than a year (and loving how comfy it is).
- All my programming knowledge is fully self taught - I picked it up during high
  school as a hobby.
