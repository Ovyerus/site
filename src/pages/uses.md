Inspired by [Natalie](https://natalie.sh/uses?ref=ovyerus.com) and
[Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses?ref=ovyerus.com), this is a fairly
comprehensive list of tools and things I use frequently. Let me know if you have
any suggestions!

## Code & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my daily driver code
  editor, and also general text editor, and has been pretty much from the very
  start (I used to use [Notepad](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) and the Atom
  editor for a very brief period, but we don't talk about that).
- My terminal of choice is the lovely [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) when I'm on
  macOS, and I'm currently using [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) on
  Linux, but may change that up at some point.
- You'll be hard pressed to see me not using
  [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) as a monospace font.
- I use [fish](https://fishshell.com) for my interactive shell, with my custom
  [lumin](https://github.com/ovyerus/lumin) prompt and a bunch of
  [extra config](https://github.com/Ovyerus/dotfiles/blob/main/home/programs/fish.nix).

## Computers

- My desktop is currently running a
  [AMD Ryzen 9 5900XT](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-9-5900xt.html)
  (16 cores) with **32GB 3200MT/s RAM** and an **AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT**, on the
  **ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS Wi-Fi** and all packed inside a
  [white Fractal North XL](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/north/north-xl/Chalk%20White/).
- My personal laptop is a MacBook Air M1 8GB RAM with 256GB storage.
- My work laptop is a MacBook Air M1 16GB RAM with 512GB storage.
- I also have a
  [Steam Deck 512GB LCD](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/) that I
  occasionally use.

## Software

- My desktop is running [NixOS](https://nixos.org), a fully declarative Linux
  distribution, with KDE Wayland for the environment. You can check out my
  system configuration in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Ovyerus/dotfiles).
- My personal MacBook runs regular macOS but also uses
  [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) on top of it, which is also
  configured through the same dotfiles repository.
- I use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) as my main browser currently, but I am
  interested in trying out [Zen](https://zen-browser.app) soon.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is my Markdown editor/note-taking app of
  choice, not that I really take any notes
- [qimgv](https://github.com/easymodo/qimgv) is the closest equivalent to the
  awesome [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com) from Windows, that I've found
  for Linux.
- I use [Affinity Suite](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) for occasional
  in-depth image editing, while I use [Pinta](https://www.pinta-project.com) for
  anything else.
- I use [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev) for managing Docker on my MacBooks, and
  also to spin up the occasional Linux VM.

## Desk Setup

- My desk is
  [Secretlab's Magnus Pro XL](https://secretlabchairs.com.au/products/magnus-pro?sku=MPB2-17I-STEALTH),
  which gives me tons of space to spread items on it (AKA make a huge mess that
  builds up over time).
- My displays are 2 AOC CQ27G2X's (1440p, 180Hz, VA panel) both horizontal,
  mounted with
  [Secretlab's Dual Monitor Arm](https://secretlabchairs.com.au/products/magnus-monitor-arm?sku=MAG-MONARM2-BLK).
- I sit on the
  [Secretlab Titan Evo XL in Arctic White](https://secretlabchairs.com.au/products/titan-evo-2022-series?sku=M08-E24SW-AWHIT1X),
  though I probably should have gone with one of their leatherette options, as
  this has stained pretty badly over time and has probably absorbed a lot of my
  sweat. In the future I hope to get some sort of Herman Miller Aeron, but
  that'll take a good deal of saving up.
- My current keyboard is the [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) with
  Sunset tactile choc switches. Previously I used the
  [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander). Both are very very nice split
  ergonomic keyboards, I just wish the Voyager had an extra column of keys on
  each side.
- My mouse is the
  [Logitech G Pro X Superlight](https://www.logitechg.com/en-au/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-006786.html)
  and my mousepad is the suuuper smooth
  [ARTISAN RAIDEN XSOFT](https://www.artisan-jp.com/cs-raiden-eng.html).
- I have some random Belkin 4-port charging hub for charging my phone, laptops,
  and also to power a miscellaneous ring light I use for bias lighting.
- I also have a small caddy for storing random doodads and my wallet & keys,
  which I modelled & 3D printed to fill out a small knitted basket I got from my
  nanna.

## Audio

- My everyday headphones are the
  [Sennheiser HD 600](https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-AU/p/hd-600).
- Audio from my desktop and my record player is sent through a
  [FIIO K7](https://www.fiio.com/k7) DAC, which gets piped through a
  [Dayton Audio DSP-408](https://www.daytonaudio.com/product/1551/dsp-408-4x8-dsp-digital-signal-processor-for-home-and-car-audio)
  for EQ, and then is finally sent to the headphones through the
  [Schiit Magni](https://www.schiit.com/products/magni-unity).
- On the go I use [Apple AirPods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/au/airpods-pro/),
  which I actually think sound pretty good.
- I also carry around a pair of
  [Audio Technica M50xBT](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-au/ath-m50xbt)'s, in
  purple! For the rare occasion that I need to plug into something for audio
  while I'm out.
- My microphone for my desktop is an
  [AKG P120](https://www.akg.com/microphones/condenser-microphones/P120-.html)
  on an
  [Elgato Wave Mic Arm LP](https://www.elgato.com/ww/en/p/wave-mic-arm-lp),
  going into a
  [1st-gen Focusrite Scarlett Solo](https://focusrite.com/products/scarlett-solo)
  as my audio interface.
