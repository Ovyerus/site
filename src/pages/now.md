I'm currently working at Birdi as a frontend developer, helping to add new
features to our web app + working towards opening it up as a SaaS platform. I
also occasionally do some backend work to help with new features, but majority
of my work resides on the frontend.

I'm also volunteering as a full-stack dev for [bots.gg](https://bots.gg) in some
of my free time.

<!-- I recently lead a merge of a few of our internal tools to help facilitate an overhaul of our approval process. -->

## Open source

Most of my free time right now is going towards programming various hobby
projects, most of which are open-source. Here's a non-exhaustive list of what
I'm particularly focused on about right now:

- [gfh](https://github.com/Ovyerus/gfh) - Git FIDO Helper, letting you sign
  using different resident FIDO SSH keys.
- [prismaliser](https://github.com/Ovyerus/prismaliser) - ERD web app for
  visualising the relationships & layout of a [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  database schema.
- [bandsnatch](https://github.com/Ovyerus/bandsnatch) - A CLI tool to help you
  download all of your Bandcamp purchases at once.

There's also some bigger projects coming down the pipeline that I'm especially
excited to bring to fruition, but they're a pretty long way out sadly.

## Music

Right now I've been listening to a lot of progressive/melodic electronic music
thanks to [Monstercat Silk](https://www.youtube.com/@monstercatsilk), as well as
revisiting [Karma Fields](https://www.youtube.com/@karmafieldsyoutube)' awesome
experimental style.

otherwise:
