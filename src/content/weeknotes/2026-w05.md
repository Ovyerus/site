atex got its first couple of pull requests this week, adding support for a
custom PLC host for identity resolution, and some updates to the OAuth module to
allow some secrets integration with other frameworks! Love to see it getting
some eyes on it from people who are wanting to help a bit. Next week, I plan to
move the generated modules for the core AT Proto lexicons out into their own
package since they do bloat the main one a bit, and then I'll release a new
version with these changes. I'm still slowly working towards getting the new
version of Drinkup finalised too, just been a bit slow in the brainspace
recently, hoping to have that out next week at some point as well.

[Arknights: Endfield](https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us) came out recently
and I gave it a try mostly on a whim. While it is a gacha game, the gameplay and
combat is actually pretty fun, and it even includes factory-building mechanics
which I wasn't expecting at all.
