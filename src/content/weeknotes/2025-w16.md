Hello world!

I had a rather eventful week! I took some much needed time off from work and was
able to get some personal work done for once. Of note is the addition of Bluesky
comments to my website, replacing the previous [Giscus](https://giscus.app)
powered system. I got inspired by [Natalie](https://natalie.sh)'s site doing the
same thing and decided it was probably the better way to go about it. If you
scroll down to the bottom of this post you should be able to see a list of
comments from the post on Bluesky (that is, if anyone has actually replied over
there)!

I plan to possibly add support for replies from the Fediverse as comments at
some point down the line, but I don't know if that will get two confusing having
different comment systems. I'll have to think about it a bit. Stay tuned!

I was up in Melbourne for the Easter weekend, to see
[Shingo Nakamura](https://www.instagram.com/shingonakamura/?hl=en) at Howler in
Brunswick! It was an incredible 9 hour(!!) gig I brought a friend along to,
which also included performances from
[Floating Dreams](https://www.floatingdreams.com.au),
[Seven Drops](https://linktr.ee/sevendropsmusic), and
[rshand](https://rshand.com), all of which were spectacular. I got some nice
photos which I might post at a later date, and I even got a photo taken with
Shingo which means a lot to me.

I hope to go to more gigs this year, need to keep an eye out on various channels
to see if anyone I follow is doing stuff in Melbourne.
