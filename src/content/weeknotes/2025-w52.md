Hello world!

Merry Christmas if you celebrate it. I spent last weekend visiting my extended
family for an early Christmas lunch and get-together, and Christmas day was a
small lunch at my parents' house. I took the opportunity to properly try out the
perfumes I got the other week going to these, and was very pleased with them.

While not busy, I've been doing a bunch more work on atex. I got a module done
for the new [permissions scopes](https://atproto.com/specs/permission) for
OAuth, and have started work on overhauling the OAuth client internally to make
it much more easier and less-weird to use, because the current implementation is
less than ideal requiring a lot of manual work for keeping the user's session in
sync. The goal is to have a stateful thing that can keep track of the session
server side and not need a whole bunch of functions called by the developer
instead.
