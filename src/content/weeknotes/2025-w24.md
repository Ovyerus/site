Hello world!

A smaller one this week, it's been rather chill.

I actually gave myself some time to relax with some gaming this week. Been
playing some modded Minecraft, just fooling around. It's definitely helped a bit
so I'm going to try and keep it up next week. Season 7 of THE FINALS also
dropped, so I might get back into that too.

More work was done on [atex](https://github.com/cometsh/atex) (the AT Protocol
library for Elixir I'm working on for Comet), adding a basic XPRC client which
is basically just a HTTP client wrapper for now, and an identity resolution
(handles and DIDs) service, with a cache currently in the works. I was planning
to get back into working on the lexicons for Comet, but I was really deep in the
identity resolution stuff and I didn't want to switch contexts. Next week
though!

Also did a little bit of gardening on the weekend. We decided to put a layer of
fabric over all the weeds to act as a barrier, and also pulled out some of the
old plants as we've started having morning frosts and they weren't looking
great. Sucks, but it gives us more space to clear weeds and do some better
planning for the next season.
