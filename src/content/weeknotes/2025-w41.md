Hello world!

I got a lot of work done on atex this week! I finished up my work on OAuth
support by writing the OAuthClient which actually lets an application interact
using tokens acquired from the login flow, and now started work on adding in
struct generation for lexicons to make creating properly branded types easier,
with the eventual goal of having XRPC calls be super simple to write.

I didn't do a ton of walking compared to last week, ended up pretty deep in work
so missed good chances to use the treadmill. I might try setting up a pomodoro
timer or something so that I get consistent breaks I can use to move around
instead of getting completely stuck into work. I did keep up with my healthier
breakfast and lunches though! Still been doing the same stuff as before as I
haven't gotten around to looking up more recipes/ideas, but I hope to soon.
