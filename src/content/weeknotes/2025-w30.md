Hello world!

I did... stuff this week. Didn't keep a close eye on things so I feel pretty
misdirected in hindsight.

I didn't end up doing any code work on Comet. Instead I've been doing some
project management-y shit, to get a proper idea of what I want to accomplish
with it and also to set some milestones to try and hit. Hopefully next week I'll
be able to make some time to continue work on my foundational libraries for it
alongside the writing, as those are independent from Comet and should be rather
generic for AT Protocol uses.

I experimented with some more self-hosted services again this week, but this
time with some budgeting apps. I am somewhat well off but I've been wanting to
have a good overview of everything as it's split between a few accounts, and
also would like to see if there's any solutions which offer something new
compared to my current options. Nothing concrete yet—I'm currently running a few
different options side-by-side for a while to see how they compare—but I might
report back here with my findings after some time.
