Hello world!

I don't have a whole lot special to talk about this week. Work was pretty
standard - though I released some features that I've been working on for a few
weeks, so that was nice. My sleep was pretty crap, going to bed well past 2am
some nights. I _really_ need to fix this.

My work on Comet stuff has been going alright, though a little slower as I'm
getting into the weeds with some more complex stuff - working on a whole bunch
of stuff with Elixir macros currently. I've been having to make some pull
requests on the library I'm using - [Peri](https://github.com/zoedsoupe/peri) -
to add some features I need, but once I'm done with that I think I'm going to be
able to go through my stuff pretty fast.

Also, next week marks 1 year of continuous weeknotes! I probably won't do
anything special for it as I only remembered recently and don't have anything
planned, but a little bit of a retrospective might be nice. We'll see come next
week.
