Hello world!

Sleep has tried its best to elude me this week. I have scratched at its heels
and managed to catch it yesterday night, but it still wasn't enough. I suppose I
should make this quick, so that I may perhaps catch up.

- I started watching
  [Severance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)>) this week,
  after encouragement from a few friends who have seen it. Halfway through
  season 1 at the moment; I think it's pretty good so far. It feels in a similar
  vein to Netflix's [Dark](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series)>)
  which I really enjoyed, so I'm looking forward to continuing with this.
- I planted a bunch of carrot seeds (multi-colour variety so they're gonna be
  pretty!) and also harvested some the mustard habaneros that were ripe finally!

  sorry).
- Started a new project as a semi-toy to learn about how the
  [ATProto](https://atproto.com) works, and potentially build it out into a real
  app/service. No information on it just yet because I don't want to hype up
  anything that is this early and could be easily dropped by me.
- I finally set up proper backups for my home server! Only doing the important
  data stuff, for the services that need it, as everything else is controlled by
  NixOS in a Git repository so it's not a problem.

This week's song is the "10 Years On" remake of
[Oh Wonder - Midnight Moon](https://youtu.be/LTcfT-w_WZk?si=bcOFP_hC9WmPnCx-).
