I had another trip to Melbourne for most of this week! For once trains were
running all the way through the Traralgon line so I didn't have any trouble with
switching to a bus or anything. I had another electrolysis session which went
rather well. I used a different numbing cream this time (TKTX, which is
"intended" for tattoo usage but it works just as well here) and actually
properly occluded it with plastic wrap, and it ended up working very well.

While I was up I also took the opportunity to go to a Halloween gig with a
friend on Friday night, run by Stupid Fuck the Silly Clown, which had a few
different acts playing. It was my first time presenting fem publicly, and it was
much less nerve wracking than I had made it up to be; hoping to build up the
confidence (and wardrobe) to do it much more regularly. Saturday night, I went
to Howler in Brunswick for dinner with friends and saw
[Seven Drops](https://linktr.ee/sevendropsmusic) there again (they were playing
alongside Shingo Nakamura when I went to see him
[[Journal/2025-W16/Review|a few months ago]]).

[ARC Raiders](https://arcraiders.com/) finally released on Thursday, but due to
being in Melbourne I wasn't able to play with my friends on launch. Over the
next week I'm going to be playing so much of it, I can't wait.
