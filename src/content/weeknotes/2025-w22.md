Hello world!

Happy Pride month! This week was really really good for me: I got some important
personal stuff sorted, alongside getting a bunch of work done!

[Comet](https://comet.sh) has been taking off these past few days. My main focus
was writing an Elixir library for listening to the ATProtocol "firehose", called
[Drinkup](https://github.com/cometsh/drinkup). It takes heavy inspiration from
the design of [Nostrum](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum) (a real robust
Discord library for Elixir), and seems to work pretty well! I'm proud of what
I've done with it currently even if it is still an early work-in-progress.

At work I finally fixed up my work around [Tus](https://tus.io) uploading and
got it out the door! It did require a bunch of extra fixing of weird cases I
forgot to account for, but now it seems to be working pretty well. I think
there's still a few odd cases, but for the most part the team is happy with it.

This week's song is
[Modera & Andrew Burrow & Susie Ledge - Dominoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yVMpHOyGn0)
