Happy new year! I had my second week off so it was quiet and I plodded away at
various personal things. I had dinner at my parents' place after New Year's
Day - chicken kiev which I haven't had in quite a while - and mostly spent the
week taking it slow.

My work on atex has been continuing, and as of writing I _just_ finished the
implementation of the new OAuth client, I just need to work on the documentation
for it and then I'm finally over this hurdle. It's much much more easy to work
with than the old version, not requiring a whole bunch of busy work to keep the
user's session in sync.

Work starts up next week, so I'll be a little slower on things, but hopefully
I'll have some more things to talk about. In the meantime, I'm going to leave
you with an album that's been on repeat a _ton_ recently,
[SHIMA - Welcome to SHIMAJIMA](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n-LoGXS0xWZyiyNXRBuaOJkNTvDvMm2Wg).
