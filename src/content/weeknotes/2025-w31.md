This week I wrapped up the vision document I've been writing for Comet, and I'm
happy with the results. It's given me a clearer direction on a roadmap for
Comet, having put some actual thought into it, so hopefully I won't get weird
and off-track down the road. One of these days I may make it public for other
people to look at and do whatever with.

Now that that piece of semi-technical writing is out of the way, I've been back
on the lexicon schema stuff I started for atex a while ago. At the moment I'm
currently in the middle of understanding Elixir's quoting system for macros and
AST, basically just crawling around the documentation until I find stuff that
might be useful. Hopefully in the next few weeks I'll have something usable with
this, but I'm trying to go slow with working on stuff so that I can give myself
a bit more time to relax somewhat.

Speaking of, I've managed to get back into the mindset to pick up playing THE
FINALS again. I haven't really touched it in a long long while for one reason or
another, most likely because I haven't really given myself time to. The few
matches I've played have been good, the current season's new map is really
really pretty. I'm hoping I can drag in a friend or two to play with sometimes
so that I can have some people I'm able to rely on, instead of having to get
frustrated with randoms from matchmaking.
