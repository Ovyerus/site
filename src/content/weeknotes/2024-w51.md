Hello world!

I visited my extended family this Christmas weekend for lunch. It was sort of a
potluck style this time around, where everyone brought their own meat to cook
and have themselves, rather than having a few roasts done as usual. We also
played "Bad Santa" (or "Dirty Santa", apparently?) for handing out gifts this
year, and I got a moka pot and some pre-ground coffee out of it. Excited to try
it out. Sadly I had to leave a bit early, but it was a nice get together and we
had a good time.

It was also the last work week of the year for me, mostly spent wrapping up some
of the stuff I'm currently working on to be in a good spot for me to return to
in the new year. I need to make sure I use the break well instead of just
playing games all the time, I'm sure I'll find some things to do (really I
should get some cleaning done around the house lol).

I didn't do any gardening this week, although I probably should've, but now that
I have some time off during the next few weeks, I'm going to try and get it done
a bit more frequently, mainly to keep clearing out weeds but also to water my
plants since it's getting pretty dry here. The tomatoes are still coming along
strong though! Very excited to see how they turn out.

This week's song is
