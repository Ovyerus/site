Hello world!

I had another electrolysis session this week so I was up in Melbourne for a few
days. Didn't have anything else going on that I was up for, so I spent a lot of
the time working on Comet with getting [Hologram](https://hologram.page/) set up
and figuring out how it works. It's actually super interesting, I hope it's not
too hard to do what I want with Comet with it.

I've also been working on an expansion to my
[astro-worker-links](https://github.com/Ovyerus/astro-worker-links) project to
support other link shortening services, since I'm looking to move away from
worker-links myself as I've been migrating away from Cloudflare over to
bunny.net, which means I need to find an alternative to worker-links since I
don't want to be using Workers anymore. I reckon I'll have a release out next
week for it.
