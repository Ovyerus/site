Hello world!

Work started back up this week, after a few weeks off for the holidays. Lots of
stuff being a little fiddly after the break but we're getting warmed up and back
into the groove of things slowly!

I did some light weeding in the middle of the week for the garden, and harvested
4 of the cherry tomatoes that had ripened. They turned out really good and I
can't wait for more to be ready soon; definitely going to be planting more this
variety next season. I also need to go to Bunnings at some point and pick out
some new seedlings to plant as I've got more space to fill in the garden.

I think next week I'm going to start experimenting with this format a little
bit, but for now I'll leave you off with this week's song which is
[Elliot Vast - Awake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgue5ClMxt0).
