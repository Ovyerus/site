Hello world!

This week was pretty quiet for me, not doing much besides usual work stuff.
Unfortunately I didn't get around to properly doing anything with oauth in atex
like I had hoped in last week's note, but I at least have set down a basic
skeleton for me to fill in the gaps by referencing a bunch of resources, so I
reckon I'll have some stuff next week to show with it!

Next week is my birthday, and I actually have a whole bunch of things planned
that I'm going up to the city for, so there'll definitely be a lot mot to talk
about then!
