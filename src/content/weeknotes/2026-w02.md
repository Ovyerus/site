Work started back up this week, and I've been getting back up to speed with
everything. We decided it'd be a good time to finally go through and upgrade all
the dependencies and tools we're using, so I've been doing that. It's a little
tedious mostly due to repetition, but it's been taking me all around the
codebase and helping me get used to it again.

I made a new, pretty big, release for atex as well. Very happy with how the new
OAuth stuff turned out because it's _wayyyyyy_ easier to use, which is exactly
what I from this. I also added a few extra things like a module for dealing with
the new [permission scopes](https://atproto.com/specs/permission) and some stuff
around caching. Now I'm working on [Drinkup](https://github.com/cometsh/drinkup)
again after such a long time, to update it to actually use atex under the hood
where possible, and to add support for some other ATProto syncing services like
[tap](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/blob/main/cmd/tap/README.md) as
I'm going to be using them for Comet.
