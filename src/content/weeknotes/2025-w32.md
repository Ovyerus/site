Hello world!

I don't have the spoons to write much this week. Shit happened.

Slow progress on atex, haven't been able to get in the right mindset as the
stuff I'm currently working on is a bunch of macro stuff I'm trying to reconcile
in my brain. I'll get it soon.

I've been playing a lot more of THE FINALS and it's been nice. Still rusty
compared to how I used to be, but I'll get better as I play. Sure it's not super
relaxing, but it's a break from other things and still works my brain somewhat,
which I often prefer.
