Hello world, happy new year!

Curiously, no new year's fireworks going off in my area when midnight hit, when
they have done previous years. I _was_ taking a shower at the time so maybe I
could've missed them, but I did hear a few isolated pops while in there so I'm
pretty sure there wasn't any big show. A shame IMO.

My Quest 3 arrived on Tuesday, and so far the experience has been really great.
The optical clarity compared to the Quest 2 is really impressive, and so is the
full-colour passthrough (compared to the black-and-white cameras of its
predecessor). I forgot how bad the default head strap on the Quest 2 was though,
and this comes with pretty much an identical design sadly; I've ordered a
third-party strap so my usage is probably going to be pretty light until that
arrives, as it will be a much more comfortable experience.

Some real stinkers weather wise today and yesterday here in Victoria, almost
hitting 40Â°C both days. Thankfully expecting rain on Monday, but the rest of the
week looks like it'll be pretty warm, but nowhere near how bad it was.

This week's song is
