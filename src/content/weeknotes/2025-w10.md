Hello world!

Short entry for this week because my brain is dumb and empty rn.

I decided to finally pull out the heirloom tomato vine this week. It's been
looking really unhealthy for the past while and the fruit weren't faring any
better, so I decided to just cut my losses. This is the second time I haven't
gotten any success out of heirloom tomatoes, so I think next season I'm going to
just try a regular variety and hope they're more resistant. In brighter news,
the "mustard" habaneros I planted alongside the tomatoes is finally starting to
bear fruit! Can't wait for them to mature and see how it turns out.

I found out about NixOS'
[specialisations](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Specialisation) feature this week,
and so I've taken this as an excuse to finally experiment with a Niri setup,
without needing to completely remove my current KDE environment. Haven't done
much with it yet but hoping to have some good progress in the coming weeks.

This week's song is
[Massane & Thandi - Lose My Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFCG30aqAvE).
