Hello world!

I had a pretty normal and chill week. Pretty much just standard work stuff. Over
on atex, I've been to add support for authentication with service proxying - a
feature of the AT Protocol that lets a user's PDS proxy calls to a particular
service with a limited-time token. So far I've been stuck on trying to decode
public keys into a usable format so that I can verify stuff properly, but no
luck at the moment. I need to do some proper reading into this format and how
keys are actually represented so I can do this correctly I think. Let's hope
it's not too hard.

I haven't been able to stop thinking about ARC Raiders since the Server Slam
event last weekend. I've been watching a tooon of videos on it over the week and
it still hasn't been enough. Sadly I'm going to be busy in the city again later
this week, so I won't be able to play it until a few days after release, so the
videos will have to suffice until then. At least I'll get a lot of content on
the few days between launch and being able to play.

I also picked up new glasses this week! Went for a purple rectangular frame this
time around, and so far I really like them. I wasn't sure of them while I was
selecting them in-store, but it ended up being a good choice.
