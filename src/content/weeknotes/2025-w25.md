Hello world!

I got sick this week, COVID again. Didn't get any work done as a result of it
taking me out for the majority of the week. On the bright side I was able to get
a solid amount of relaxation in with gaming.

On a whim I decided to finally play Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and I've been
having a blast. The gameplay is really solid, and it feels great to control on
keyboard and mouse. My only real gripe is that not all actions have a
corresponding keybind setting, which is a pain in the ass since I use Colemak,
and means I need to do some rebinds when I want to do something in a certain
case (most notably when switching planets because the key it uses for confirming
the selection, R, is my "move backwards" key), but besides that it's been fine.

I also played a bit more modded Minecraft alongside that, playing the
[SteamPunk](https://modrinth.com/modpack/steam-punk) modpack by Luna Pixel. It's
been pretty fun; I haven't messed around a lot with modern mods so it's good to
see a bunch of the stuff that's available. Create is an obvious highlight thanks
to its aesthetics.
