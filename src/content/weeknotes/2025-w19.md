Hello world!

Phoning it in this week as I've been very eepy today and this week wasn't that
interesting.

- Finally started work on a progressive/melodic/deep house DJ mix I've been
  thinking of for a while. I bought a Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 a while ago and been
  learning how to use it. It's been nice.
- More weeding in terms of gardening. Still haven't gotten around to planning
  what I want to plant this winter/upcoming months. Really need to do that at
  some point soon.
- I finished
  [Lushfoil Photography Sim](https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/lushfoil-photography-sim).
  Was a fun and relaxing experience. Might try out the time-trial/100% it
  soonish.
- Started work on an ATProto project finally. Very very very early days but
  hopefully I'll find motivation to keep going through with it.
