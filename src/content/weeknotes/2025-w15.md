Hello world!

This edition's a little late because I was a little busy last night and earlier
today. I caught a cold this past week. Not sure exactly where I caught it from,
but thankfully I've mostly gotten over it now as it was just rather mild. Still
waiting for my sinuses to fully recover.

I did quit ea bit of gaming this week. I got my third ever win in
[Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com) _finally_, and started playing
[Stellaris](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/stellaris/about) for the
first time, with my housemates. I was a little resistant to it at first but as
we've gotten further into the game I've warmed up a bit and I'm finding it
rather enjoyable now.

I didn't really get up to much else noteworthy this week sadly, in part due to
the cold. However this coming week is going to be relatively big for me and I'm
very excited, but I'm going to leave that for next-week me to write about.

This week's song is
[Pendulum & Armin van Buuren & Rob Swire - Sound of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkALtin4Lf4).
