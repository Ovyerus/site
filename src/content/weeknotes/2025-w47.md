I spent my free time this week finishing up the refactor of my self-hosted
setup, moving some services around and preparing some old VMs for
decommissioning. In the process I also decided to finally get around to moving
off of Cloudflare over to Bunny.net. Was actually rather painless, the only
"problem" has been finding alternatives to a few Workers I've been using for CDN
and shortlink purposes, but the former was easily solved with Bunny's CDN stuff
combined with Backblaze B2, and the latter is solved by any open-source
alternative (I'm looking at moving to
[chhoto-url](https://github.com/SinTan1729/chhoto-url) currently).

I still have yet to pick work on atex back up, but I'm getting there. Now all
this is out of the way it's likely I'll force myself to _finally_ do it, so that
I can get progress on Comet progressing as it's been hell of a while since
anything happened.
