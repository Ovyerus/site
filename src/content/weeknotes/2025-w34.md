Hello world!

I've been keeping up the better bedtimes this past week. Some have been a
_little_ later than I'd like, but it's still been much better than how it was
previously, so I'm not sad.

In atex I finally finished writing the `deflexicon` macro! I also wrote a
command line tool for it which will read a directory of lexicons (based on a
glob pattern) and output them into modules which use the macro. I haven't tagged
a new release for it yet though, as I've ran into a few hiccups while testing it
out on the atproto/Bluesky lexicons, but I'm going to get around to that next
week.

I've been getting pretty deep into using
[Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) recently. At work this week I had
the opportunity to properly show it off to my team and demonstrate some of the
ways it's helped while coding, particularly in restoring to previous repository
states and the way that merge resolutions get propagated through a change stack.
With it, I've also been getting into the flow of creating a bunch of empty "WIP"
commits and treating them as a to-do list of sorts. Having flexibility over the
commit history has been super useful.
