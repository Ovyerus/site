Hello world!

I did some good things this week. I've finally been making a concerted effort
for getting into bed before midnight. It's definitely been helping a bunch in
the following mornings with not feeling as drained, so I hope I'm able to
properly keep this up and fix my sleep for real (it's still pretty crap as it
is).

I did some pretty big work on Comet and adjacent stuff! A few days ago I
released
[the public roadmap](https://bsky.app/profile/comet.sh/post/3lwftbt544k2l) for
Comet. This is based off milestones I had set in my vision document I wrote the
other week, and I think they represent my plan for the project pretty well.
Additionally, I also finished the initial version of my `deflexicon` macro in
atex, which takes in a Lexicon definition and converts it to schemas for runtime
validation of inputs. Next steps is for some typespec generation from it so that
the validated data can be referred to easily, I think it should be easy enough,
especially now that most of the heavy lifting is done.

And finally, I got myself some Lego sets -
[Lucky Bamboo 10344](https://www.lego.com/en-au/product/lucky-bamboo-10344) and
[Tranquil Garden 10315](https://www.lego.com/en-au/product/tranquil-garden-10315) -
as I was feeling a bit down and wanted to get something nice for myself. I built
them over the weekend and found it to be a nice change of pace (and it took my
computer off my direct focus so I think it was good in that regards too). I
don't get myself fun things as much as I probably should. I should change that.
