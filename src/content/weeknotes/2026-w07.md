Hello world!

This week was pretty uneventful for the most part, but my weekend was jam-packed
as I was moving house! Now I'm a lot closer to the city, so doing all those
trips I did before will be muuuch easier for me, and I'm hoping to go to more
concerts too as a result.

I've picked up work on Comet properly now that most of my library work is out of
the way. Have been fiddling a bit with [Hologram](https://hologram.page/), it is
actually much earlier than I expected (Regex doesn't work on the current
released version) so I might end up taking a poke around it and seeing if I can
contribute to it so I can have Comet use it because I think that would be fun.
Otherwise if it comes to it, I can use a more typical frontend framework in the
meantime, and maybe do a rewrite in the future once it's more capable (mostly
just because I think a full-Elixir web app would be fun!).
