Hello world!

I missed last week's entry and didn't remember until it was pretty late! As a
result I'm going to merge some of last week's stuff in here, so that they aren't
lost.

## Last week (2025-W20)

- I picked up [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com) again after a few weeks of
  not playing. During that time I've been watching _a lot_ of the streamer
  [Roffle](https://www.youtube.com/@RoffleLite) and learnt quite a bit from him,
  especially in regards to cutting unwanted cards from your deck. As a result, I
  was able to score a pretty good run on Black Deck, reaching ante 12 for the
  first time.
- I've been re-watching all of [EthosLab's](https://www.youtube.com/@EthosLab)
  Life Series episodes while I've been working. Good background noise and it's
  been nice revisiting them.
- I decided to go public with my ATProtocol project! It's called
  [Comet](https://bsky.app/profile/comet.sh) and is aiming to be a decentralised
  music-streaming platform. It's still very early days (still in the process of
  fleshing out the lexicons), but hoping it turns out well.

## This week

- I got some new file uploading stuff finished at work (using the
  [Tus](https://tus.io) protocol), only for it to break in a weird way because I
  had misunderstood how the library expected to work, as I wasn't initially
  giving it a determinate ID, among a few other small things.
- My momentum on Comet has been going good. The base record lexicons are done (I
  think) and I'm currently working on some stuff in Elixir to be used for the
  AppView. It's pretty deep in the weeds as a bunch of this stuff doesn't have
  any pre-existing Elixir/BEAM implementations, but it's coming along well.
- Haven't really played any games this week sadly, I'm pretty bad at giving
  myself some proper leisure time. Really need to work on that.
