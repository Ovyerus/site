Hello world!

I finally finished up the (initial) documentation for atex's OAuth
implementation and got it pushed! A new release hasn't been cut for it yet
although it has been pushed, as I still need to make a XRPC client which can
actually work with the authentication from the OAuth flow, but it's actually got
some momentum behind it again so I'm happy with how I'm going.

I've also been keeping up with my health goals really well this week. I managed
to get about an hour of walking on the treadmill each day in-between work, which
is where I want to be in terms of exercise. Combined with my semi-daily shopping
trips, it's been pretty substantial and I've been feeling really good about it!
On the nutrition side I've mostly been doing the same chia seed puddings &
chickpea salad as other weeks recently, but I am looking into other recipes so I
don't get bored and drop everything.
