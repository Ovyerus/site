I've been moving along very slowly this week.

Not sure why, just can't seem to get a move on things outside of work, and even
that stuff is slower than I like.

My sleep has been pretty terrible, haven't put much effort into going to bed at
a reasonable time and it's been affecting me a lot I think; it's probably the
main reason for being so slow. I need to actually start forcing myself into bed
before midnight consistently.

I picked up Hytale this week, after watching a few stream VODs and episodes of
Minecraft YouTubers I watch. The combat system is pretty fleshed out, with
blocking, charged attacks, special abilities, and several different weapon types
all of which behave differently. It'll be interesting to see how it grows over
time.
