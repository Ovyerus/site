Hello world!

It's been a mostly work focused week for me. I didn't really carve out any time
for leisure (most likely to my detriment), but I've made really good progress on
my own projects too at least.

## Work

More problems crept up with my Tus uploads project at work again, so I made the
decision to split it off into a microservice using
[tusd](https://tus.github.io/tusd/). It's shown promise in testing, especially
with large files, so I'm hoping that this will be the final iteration of my
efforts in this space! We'll see next week.

## Comet

Work on [Comet](https://comet.sh) has been going extremely well. While I didn't
do much on the core platform or lexicons, I've been doing work on core Elixir AT
Protocol tooling to help me build the AppView, as there isn't a lot of high
quality stuff for Elixir. This week I got parsing of `at://` URIs and TIDs
accomplished, and started work on an XRPC client and a schema system to be
plugged into that!

While working, I rewatched Etho's playthrough of the
[Project Ozone 2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAVDbMg_XAoIzvMEoPyg7mW0T0gDZezo)
modpack for Minecraft, for the 3rd or 4th time. It was a pretty bingey rewatch,
I got through it in a few days while having it constantly in the background. I
wish he had the time to do more modded stuff these days, as I think his modded
series throughout the years have been some of the best stuff he's done.

This week's song is
[Morgin Madison & Jarod Glawe - Weakness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=503lOeA1Zkg).
