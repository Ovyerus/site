subtitle: "Experiments #1 - Emoji Dot Points"
---

📝 This is the first of (hopefully) a few format experiments I'll be doing here
along the next few weeks, trying some different ideas out to see if there's
anything that jives with me a little better than the pure paragraph dumps I've
been doing since I started weeknotes a few months ago. This week I'm taking
inspiration from [Kerri Krueger](https://notes.krueger.ink)'s weeknotes, with
some short emoji dot points of what's been going on.

🌿 I cleared a huge section of the garden of tall weeds using the whipper
snipper this week, mostly to tidy up that part so it looked more tended to
overall, but also to eventually fully clear it to have some more growing room
for new plants!

💅 Finally got a new set of nail polish after not being able to find my old
stash last week (which is a huge shame, hopefully it'll pop up again at some
point) and painted my nails for the first time in a while :).
