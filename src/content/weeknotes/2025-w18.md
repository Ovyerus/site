Hello world!

Sunday already, huh? I had a fairly bog standard week personally. The weather
was rather rainy and chilly, as it's finally realising we're near the end of
Autumn, and I'm back up to speed properly at work, as well as finally properly
over my cold!

I bought and played
[Lushfoil Photography Sim](https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/lushfoil-photography-sim)
this week. It's a really beautiful game about going around taking photos of
things, modelled after some of the creator's trips around the world. The cameras
in the game are beautifully modelled in their mechanics, and it's a nice chill
vibe to relax with. Highly recommend.

We had our federal election here in Australia on Saturday. Labor won and kept
control, and the opposition lost so bad the head of the party lost his seat lol.
Sadly still no minority government, but it is what it is I guess.

I finally was able to get back into the garden for a bit after my bouts of
illness and the weather being fucky, and had a bunch of rogue grass and weeds to
fight that had grown back up. I should look into ways to properly get rid of a
bunch of grass for good, but there's probably no simple/easy way to do so
without affecting any of the existing plants. I dunno.
