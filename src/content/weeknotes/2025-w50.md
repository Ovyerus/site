Hello world!

This week I finished up my work on
[astro-shortlinks](https://github.com/Ovyerus/astro-shortlinks) and got it
properly released! This officially replaces my old `astro-worker-links` plugin
to provide more general usefulness for everyone, supporting multiple different
providers. Currently I only have built-in support for chhoto-url and
worker-links, but I made it pretty easy to add new ones in the future as needed.

Over on Comet, I've started working on a small
[Statusphere](https://atproto.com/guides/applications) example for atex, just to
see if there's any areas that I've missed or gone in the wrong direction with
it, before I get caught out in the middle of building Comet properly and thus
get sidetracked and blow off my momentum. I've already caught an oversight in my
OAuth implementation so it's been a good idea so far!
