Hello world!

Bit of a downer week for me, personally. The weather has been less than ideal,
so I didn't go on any walks or do any gardening sadly. And the last few days
have been less than ideal, but I'm making it through. It wasn't all bad though.

On two of the milder days during the week, I decided to some intense VR
sessions, playing through new [Synth Riders](https://synthridersvr.com/) maps
and progressing through [Until You Fall](https://untilyoufall.schellgames.com/).
I hope to try and keep this up as an alternative to walking for exercise,
especially on days where I can't/don't want to go walking.

I set up [Immich](https://immich.app/) on my home server as an experiment. Going
to go through and sort some of the media into albums and whatnot just to see how
it is. It's also good to have a backup that isn't just tied to Apple (I do need
to set up Borg backups for it though). I also installed a drive bay for the
server to clean up the birds nest that was the drives just being scattered all
over the insides of the case. I also had a case where two drives weren't
connected properly for some reason so had dropped out of the ZFS pool, but
putting everything into the bay has fixed that and it's all working normally
now!

This week's song is
[MOTSA, Jody Wisternoff & James Grant - Feel This Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3P_Gjf8eUg).
