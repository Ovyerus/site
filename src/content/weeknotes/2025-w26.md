Hello world!

Another pretty late one this time around. My sense of time has been a little off
recently, no thanks in part to being sick last week. This has also reflected in
my work: it's been pretty slow but I have ideas brewing.

With [atex](https://github.com/cometsh/atex), I finished up my identity resolver
service and cache for a new release. Did some light testing with Drinkup and it
works as I expected, but there'll be a real trail by fire when I use it for
Comet. Now, I've started work on a macro to convert a lexicon definition into a
bunch of schemas for validation. I haven't really written macros before in
Elixir so it'll be a bit of a challenge but it sounds exciting.

Part way through working on atex this week, I found out about
[jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) (or `jj`) through
[a blog post from Sandy Maguire](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/jj-strategy/).
So far it hasn't been too much different from my use of Git, but I did use it's
switching stuff to "go back in time" to create a release commit because I had
forgotten to do so before starting a new feature. It turned out to be way nicer
than manually stashing my current work and going about it that way, so I'm
excited to see what else this tool can do for me in the VCS space.
