This was a pretty good week for my packages.
[Drinkup 0.2.0](https://tangled.org/comet.sh/drinkup) finally released with new
support for the Jetstream and Tap services! And
[atex](https://tangled.org/comet.sh/atex) got a smaller release containing the
pull requests from last week, as well as a change separating out the
pre-converted `com.atproto` lexicons into their own package because I felt they
were bloating the main package a bit.

I'll be doing a lot of packing next week, in preparation for moving house on the
weekend! Thankfully have a lot less stuff to move compared to last time so it's
not going to be so bad, and I'm actually prepared comparatively, so hopefully it
goes smoothly! My next weeknote will be a little bit after I've moved, so I'll
be able to talk about how it went a little bit.
