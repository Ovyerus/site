I had another trip to Melbourne this week. I had my usual electrolysis
appointment which went well, and I went to a gig with friends. We saw Shingo
Nakamura again as he was a guest on Nils Hoffmann's Everlight tour in Australia!
He put on another really great show, and unfortunately we weren't able to stay
around for the entire event due to trains and whatnot, but we still had a good
time.

I've been doing some work on Drinkup to add support for other services
(Jetstream and Tap), and it's looking pretty good after some testing. Just need
to finish up the documentation and I think I'll do the release next week. Pretty
soon I'll be able to finally get a proper start on Comet since it seems that all
the underlying libraries are pretty much good enough to go now!
