99% of my free time this week was spent in ARC Raiders. At the time of writing,
I've managed to sink 50 hours over the past week into it. It's been _incredibly_
fun, but unfortunately has really taken my focus away from atex and other
projects. I'm hoping I can have the excitement cool down a little bit, as I
would like to get back into programming, and also it's been affecting my sleep
somewhat (but it hasn't affected my work _yet_).

Underscores released [Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd0j0xnhWFw) this
week and it has been stuck in my head since it came out. Not sure what about it
is the exact cause, but it's really catchy and the music video is pretty fun
(choreography!!).
